            <design_constraints>
                <constraint>Use Stripe-like frictionless workflows: create/edit actions should open centered modals or slide-out drawers instead of disruptive full-page forms.</constraint>
                <constraint>Use a Viedoc-style bento layout: soft floating white cards on an off-white background for dashboards and dense data views.</constraint>
                <constraint>Apply the Paper Replacement palette: app background near #F9FAFB, white cards, calm trustworthy accents (teal/sage/cerulean), and reserve red for critical alerts only.</constraint>
                <constraint>Preserve high-legibility typography: clean sans-serif (Inter/SF Pro/Halyard), bold patient names, slate-gray secondary metadata.</constraint>
                <constraint>Honor the one-click rule where applicable: keep the global + action for Add Appointment, Add Patient, and Create Invoice visible and easy to reach.</constraint>
                <constraint>Add educational empty states with clear CTAs for first-time or empty datasets.</constraint>
            </design_constraints>

        <instruction>
            <step>Implement the scoped changes for Build Invoice Generator Drawer/Modal UI with Appointment Autofill in the planned files (healio/components/billing/invoice-generator-drawer.tsx, healio/components/billing/invoice-line-items-editor.tsx, healio/components/billing/invoice-form.tsx) while preserving the PRD-aligned project structure.</step>
            <step>Apply validation, error handling, and consistent response/UI behavior so the task output integrates cleanly with existing helpers and patterns.</step>
            <step>Wire integrations and dependencies for this task (endpoints: POST /api/v1/invoices, PATCH /api/v1/invoices/:id) and keep tenant scoping/RBAC/security expectations intact where applicable.</step>
            <step>Prefer in-context modal/drawer workflows, scannable bento cards, and educational empty states so the UI matches the requested Healio experience.</step>
            <step>Verify keyboard/focus behavior, touch target sizing, and mobile responsiveness before marking the task ready.</step>
            <validation_checklist>
                <check>Exercise the related endpoint(s): POST /api/v1/invoices, PATCH /api/v1/invoices/:id and verify response shape/status codes.</check>
                <check>Run lint/typecheck or the smallest relevant test suite for the files changed by this task.</check>
                <check>Manually verify desktop and mobile layouts plus focus/keyboard behavior for the primary interaction path.</check>
                <check>Use Chrome DevTools MCP to verify the implemented UI in-browser (desktop + mobile), check interactions, inspect console errors, and capture a validation snapshot before marking done.</check><check>Capture a screenshot or short note confirming empty/loading/error states are present where applicable.</check>

            <acceptance_criteria>
                <criterion>The deliverable for Build Invoice Generator Drawer/Modal UI with Appointment Autofill is implemented in the referenced files and compiles without breaking adjacent modules.</criterion>
                <criterion>Task output matches the PRD scope (Feature 4 Invoice Generator + user Stripe workflow guidance) and remains bounded to an atomic &lt;=45-minute implementation chunk.</criterion>
                <criterion>Related endpoint behavior returns the standard success/error envelope and respects auth/public route expectations for the route class.</criterion>
                <criterion>UI states (loading, empty, error, success) are present and visually consistent with Healio bento cards, off-white background, and trust-oriented styling.</criterion>
                <criterion>Interactions are keyboard accessible and usable on mobile without disruptive navigation when a modal/drawer workflow is appropriate.</criterion>

            <verification_command>npm run typecheck; Chrome DevTools MCP on http://localhost:4012/billing (create/edit invoice drawer flow, desktop/mobile, network, console)</verification_command>
            <verification_notes>Implemented Stripe-style in-context invoice generator drawer and edit drawer flow on the billing dashboard. Chrome DevTools MCP verification covered create invoice (POST 201), edit invoice (PATCH 200), appointment autofill, toast feedback, mobile layout (390x844), and Escape-key drawer close. A runtime crash caused by reading pooled React event objects inside functional setState callbacks was discovered during MCP verification and fixed in invoice-form field handlers.</verification_notes>

                <item>When work starts/completes, record changed files, test commands, screenshots (UI tasks), and commit/PR references here.</item>
                <item>Include Chrome DevTools MCP evidence (snapshot/screenshot reference and notes on responsive + interaction checks) here before marking frontend tasks complete.</item>
                <item>Changed files: healio/app/(dashboard)/billing/page.tsx, healio/components/billing/invoice-list.tsx, healio/hooks/useInvoices.ts, healio/components/billing/invoice-form.tsx, healio/components/billing/invoice-generator-drawer.tsx, healio/components/billing/invoice-line-items-editor.tsx.</item>
                <item>Typecheck: `npm run typecheck` initially failed due invoice-form taxMode union inference; fixed by introducing explicit form-state typing and reran successfully.</item>
                <item>Chrome DevTools MCP desktop verification on `http://localhost:4012/billing`: opened `New Invoice` drawer, filled patient/appointment, clicked `Autofill`, confirmed line item + notes/totals preview updates, submitted create flow, and observed invoice row + success toast.</item>
                <item>Chrome DevTools MCP network verification: `POST /api/v1/invoices` returned 201 (reqid=601), `GET /api/v1/invoices/:id` returned 200 while opening edit (reqid=603/608), and `PATCH /api/v1/invoices/:id` returned 200 (reqid=606).</item>
                <item>Chrome DevTools MCP edit verification: opened invoice edit drawer, changed status to Sent and paid amount to 100.00, saved successfully, and confirmed list row status/paid/balance values updated with toast feedback.</item>
                <item>Chrome DevTools MCP console/runtime verification: initial test exposed `TypeError: Cannot read properties of null (reading 'value')` from pooled event access in `invoice-form.tsx`; patched handlers to capture values synchronously, reloaded page, then console returned no messages.</item>
                <item>Chrome DevTools MCP mobile verification: resized to `390x844`, opened edit drawer, confirmed responsive layout and mobile nav visibility, then pressed `Escape` to close the drawer.</item>
                <item>Feature commit: 8e2fb74 (feat(healio-billing): invoice generator drawer ui).</item>
