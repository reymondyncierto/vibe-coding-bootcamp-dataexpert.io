            <background>This task implements Implement Analytics Aggregate Service with Caching for Healio and is scoped as one atomic work item aligned to the PRD. It should be completed within 45 mins and leave clear evidence for follow-on tasks.</background>

        <instruction>
            <step>Implement the scoped changes for Implement Analytics Aggregate Service with Caching in the planned files (healio/services/analyticsService.ts, healio/lib/cache.ts, healio/tests/unit/analytics-service.test.ts) while preserving the PRD-aligned project structure.</step>
            <step>Apply validation, error handling, and consistent response/UI behavior so the task output integrates cleanly with existing helpers and patterns.</step>
            <step>Wire integrations and dependencies for this task (endpoints: none) and keep tenant scoping/RBAC/security expectations intact where applicable.</step>
            <step>Add or update focused tests (unit/integration) for critical business rules, idempotency, or security behavior introduced by this task.</step>
            <step>Document assumptions and any follow-on schema/API contracts in code comments or lightweight docs when they affect downstream tasks.</step>
            <validation_checklist>
                <check>Run lint/typecheck or the smallest relevant test suite for the files changed by this task.</check>
                <check>Validate security/tenant behavior with at least one negative test or rejection scenario when applicable.</check>
                <check>Record evidence of persistence/side effects (DB row change, log entry, webhook event handling, cache behavior, etc.) as applicable.</check>

            <acceptance_criteria>
                <criterion>The deliverable for Implement Analytics Aggregate Service with Caching is implemented in the referenced files and compiles without breaking adjacent modules.</criterion>
                <criterion>Task output matches the PRD scope (Feature 9 Analytics Dashboard; 6.2 Caching Strategy) and remains bounded to an atomic &lt;=45-minute implementation chunk.</criterion>
                <criterion>Business rules, tenant scoping, and security constraints relevant to this task are enforced (validation, idempotency, RBAC, webhook/cron protection, etc.).</criterion>
                <criterion>At least one verification artifact (test case, curl call, or fixture-driven check) proves the new behavior works and regressions are covered.</criterion>

            <verification_notes>Added an in-memory TTL cache utility (`lib/cache.ts`) and clinic-scoped analytics aggregate service with cache-aware dashboard metrics, trend buckets, and service breakdowns sourced from the existing invoice/appointment/patient stores. The analytics unit test verifies tenant isolation, aggregation math, and cache-hit behavior on the second call.</verification_notes>
            <evidence>
                <item>When work starts/completes, record changed files, test commands, screenshots (UI tasks), and commit/PR references here.</item>
                <item>Changed files: healio/lib/cache.ts, healio/services/analyticsService.ts, healio/tests/unit/analytics-service.test.ts.</item>
                <item>Cache behavior verification: analytics service returns `cache.hit=false` on first request and `cache.hit=true` on second identical request within TTL.</item>
                <item>Tenant isolation verification: clinic_2 appointments/invoices seeded in the test do not affect clinic_1 analytics totals or service breakdown.</item>
                <item>Aggregation verification: test asserts billed/collected/outstanding cents, paid/overdue invoice counts, completed/no-show appointment counts, and trend/service breakdown generation.</item>
                <item>Typecheck/tests passed: `npm run typecheck`; `node --import tsx --test tests/unit/analytics-service.test.ts`.</item>

            <completion_signal>Task is done only when state=DONE, is_done=true, completed_at is filled, verification_status=PASSED, and evidence records changed files/tests/screenshots as applicable.</completion_signal>
