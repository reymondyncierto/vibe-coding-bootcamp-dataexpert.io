            <background>This task implements Implement Appointments List/Create API Route for Healio and is scoped as one atomic work item aligned to the PRD. It should be completed within 40 mins and leave clear evidence for follow-on tasks.</background>

        <instruction>
            <step>Implement the scoped changes for Implement Appointments List/Create API Route in the planned files (healio/app/api/v1/appointments/route.ts, healio/services/appointmentService.ts) while preserving the PRD-aligned project structure.</step>
            <step>Apply validation, error handling, and consistent response/UI behavior so the task output integrates cleanly with existing helpers and patterns.</step>
            <step>Wire integrations and dependencies for this task (endpoints: GET /api/v1/appointments?date=YYYY-MM-DD, POST /api/v1/appointments) and keep tenant scoping/RBAC/security expectations intact where applicable.</step>
            <step>Add or update focused tests (unit/integration) for critical business rules, idempotency, or security behavior introduced by this task.</step>
            <step>Document assumptions and any follow-on schema/API contracts in code comments or lightweight docs when they affect downstream tasks.</step>
            <validation_checklist>
                <check>Exercise the related endpoint(s): GET /api/v1/appointments?date=YYYY-MM-DD, POST /api/v1/appointments and verify response shape/status codes.</check>
                <check>Run lint/typecheck or the smallest relevant test suite for the files changed by this task.</check>
                <check>Validate security/tenant behavior with at least one negative test or rejection scenario when applicable.</check>
                <check>Record evidence of persistence/side effects (DB row change, log entry, webhook event handling, cache behavior, etc.) as applicable.</check>

            <acceptance_criteria>
                <criterion>The deliverable for Implement Appointments List/Create API Route is implemented in the referenced files and compiles without breaking adjacent modules.</criterion>
                <criterion>Task output matches the PRD scope (Feature 2 API Endpoints) and remains bounded to an atomic &lt;=45-minute implementation chunk.</criterion>
                <criterion>Related endpoint behavior returns the standard success/error envelope and respects auth/public route expectations for the route class.</criterion>
                <criterion>Business rules, tenant scoping, and security constraints relevant to this task are enforced (validation, idempotency, RBAC, webhook/cron protection, etc.).</criterion>
                <criterion>At least one verification artifact (test case, curl call, or fixture-driven check) proves the new behavior works and regressions are covered.</criterion>

            <verification_notes>Implemented protected appointments list/create route using middleware auth headers (`x-healio-*`) and standard API envelopes. Added in-memory internal appointment store + list/create service methods with scheduling validation integration. Route-handler tests exercise GET/POST endpoint behavior (including overlap conflict and unauthenticated rejection) without depending on middleware runtime.</verification_notes>

                <item>Changed files: healio/app/api/v1/appointments/route.ts, healio/services/appointmentService.ts, healio/tests/unit/appointments-route.test.ts.</item>

                <item>Endpoint exercise (route-handler tests): `node --import tsx --test tests/unit/appointments-route.test.ts` passed; verifies POST create (201), GET day list (200), overlap rejection (409 `OVERLAPPING_APPOINTMENT`), and missing auth headers rejection (401).</item>
                <item>Route uses middleware auth context headers (`x-healio-clinic-id`, `x-healio-user-id`, `x-healio-role`) and rejects direct calls without them to fail closed.</item>
