            <background>This task implements Create GitHub Actions CI Workflow (Lint/Typecheck/Tests/Build) for Healio and is scoped as one atomic work item aligned to the PRD. It should be completed within 40 mins and leave clear evidence for follow-on tasks.</background>

            <step>Implement the scoped changes for Create GitHub Actions CI Workflow (Lint/Typecheck/Tests/Build) in the planned files (healio/.github/workflows/ci.yml) while preserving the PRD-aligned project structure.</step>
            <step>Apply validation, error handling, and consistent response/UI behavior so the task output integrates cleanly with existing helpers and patterns.</step>
            <step>Wire integrations and dependencies for this task (endpoints: none) and keep tenant scoping/RBAC/security expectations intact where applicable.</step>
            <step>Add or update focused tests (unit/integration) for critical business rules, idempotency, or security behavior introduced by this task.</step>
            <step>Document assumptions and any follow-on schema/API contracts in code comments or lightweight docs when they affect downstream tasks.</step>
            <validation_checklist>
                <check>Run lint/typecheck or the smallest relevant test suite for the files changed by this task.</check>
                <check>Validate security/tenant behavior with at least one negative test or rejection scenario when applicable.</check>
                <check>Record evidence of persistence/side effects (DB row change, log entry, webhook event handling, cache behavior, etc.) as applicable.</check>

                <criterion>The deliverable for Create GitHub Actions CI Workflow (Lint/Typecheck/Tests/Build) is implemented in the referenced files and compiles without breaking adjacent modules.</criterion>
                <criterion>Task output matches the PRD scope (7.3 CI/CD Pipeline) and remains bounded to an atomic &lt;=45-minute implementation chunk.</criterion>
                <criterion>Business rules, tenant scoping, and security constraints relevant to this task are enforced (validation, idempotency, RBAC, webhook/cron protection, etc.).</criterion>
                <criterion>At least one verification artifact (test case, curl call, or fixture-driven check) proves the new behavior works and regressions are covered.</criterion>

            <verification_notes>Added GitHub Actions workflow `healio/.github/workflows/ci.yml` that runs install, typecheck, unit tests, integration tests, Playwright E2E discovery smoke, and Next.js build with placeholder CI env vars. The pipeline is scoped to Healio path changes and uses npm cache for `healio/package-lock.json`.</verification_notes>
            <evidence>
                <item>When work starts/completes, record changed files, test commands, screenshots (UI tasks), and commit/PR references here.</item>
                <item>Changed files: healio/.github/workflows/ci.yml.</item>
                <item>Workflow includes `npm ci`, `npm run typecheck`, `npm run test:unit`, `npm run test:integration`, `npm run e2e:list`, and `npm run build` in `healio/` working directory.</item>
                <item>CI env placeholders added for Supabase/Stripe/DB/encryption/cron variables so build-time validation and route imports can run in GitHub Actions.</item>
