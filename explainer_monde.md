## 2–3 sentence description of the problem you solved

Healio solves the problem faced by solo practitioners and small clinics (1–5 doctors) that cannot afford enterprise EMRs but still need to move beyond paper charts, WhatsApp scheduling, and manual billing. These clinics often operate with fragmented tools and manual workflows, which slows down appointments, patient record management, billing, and follow-up communication. Healio provides a single, modern system that centralizes those core clinic operations without the complexity and cost of enterprise platforms.
